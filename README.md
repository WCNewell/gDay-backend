# The gDay App: A Group Project in the Making

## This Project consists of both a front and backend repository

* The gDay app is being developed to support a proposed annual alumni day or weekend extravaganza for galvanize students. Please visit theAboutForGday.md for more information.

* Built with HTML, CSS Grid, JavaScript, Vue.js, Node.js, Cloudinary, Postman, Cypress, Express, Knex, Postgresql. The frontend was deployed with Surge, and the backend was deployed using Heroku.

* The current repository is created to house the backend or database structure and files for a galvanize g75 group project called gDay.

* The frontend repository hosts the client.

* To run this application locally, clone both the frontend <https://github.com/SavannahAdamsss/gDay.git> and backend <https://github.com/SavannahAdamsss/gDay-backend.git> repositories, use lite-server, live-server, or npm run dev from the terminal.

# The Plan

With the gDay web application our team seeks to create a platform for bringing together gSchool alumni, instructors, and support staff for an annual two-day extravaganza — filled with tech talks, guest speakers, hackathons, product demos, workshops, an alumni picnic, and happy hour. Our team created this application to invoke a vision of what an official 'Galvanize Alumni Day' might look like.

## A Celebration

A big part of the Galvanize experience is about networking with your peers and being involved in the tech community. We want to continue that tradition, post-graduation by curating an opportunity to reconnect with friends, re-engage with our dynamic network of blossoming and seasoned professionals, and of course, celebrating the wondrous experience in which we all share.

## Be Inspired

gDay is more than a reunion. It’s a place to learn and grow professionally and be introduced to new concepts and technologies. Topics and workshops range from DevOps to UX/UI design, "what's new in tech", and even the current Galvanize curriculum.

Event suggestions and general inquiries can be submitted via the community portal.

Sign up today and we'll see you soon at gDay 2019!
